#Prompt App
This is a side project I'm building for writers who want to practice writing every day. The idea is simple: have a different categories of prompts that randomly generate and a rule that you have to write a minimum of 300 words based off your prompt.

##MVP
- User is able to go to site and click "generate" to produce different prompts
- User is able to select different categories of prompts (min 3 categories)

##Stretch goals
- User sets up account and can write inside app
- User gets alerts to go to app and write
- User can share writing through platform, social networks, medium

##Possible monetization
- Affiliate links to books
- Links to my site to build blogs for people
- Ads
